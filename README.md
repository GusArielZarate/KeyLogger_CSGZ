# KeyLogger_CSGZ
A key logger that records all the characters typed into the keyboard when the code is running.
Install the "requirements.txt" with the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt
## How to use:
After installing the requirements you just need to run the main file with the following command: "python main.go"
on the terminal.
When the main.py is running it will create a log file that will record all the activity on the keyboard until you press "esc".
## Examples:
Terminal: 
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.go

input example: "hola como estas"

file created "aquitucontrasenia.log" and will contain:
hola como estas
